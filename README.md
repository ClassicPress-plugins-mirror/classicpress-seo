# Classic SEO Plugin (Experimental)

Classic SEO is the first SEO plugin built specifically to work with ClassicPress. The plugin contains many essential SEO tools to help optimize your website.

This plugin was created largely as a result of the following ClassicPress petitions:

- https://petitions.classicpress.net/posts/175/allow-editing-of-page-title-and-meta-description-seo
- https://petitions.classicpress.net/posts/176/auto-xml-sitemap-generation-seo


**Minimum Requirements:**

- ClassicPress 1.0.2
- PHP 7.0

**As this plugin is still in the development & testing stage, please do not use it on a production site.**

## Credits
This is a fork of Rank Math.
